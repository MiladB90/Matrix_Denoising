. Model
  .  M = snr * u * v^t + noise
  . observes ~ Ber(p)
  . Mhat = argmin ||X||_nuc s.t. X_observes = M_pbservese
. Parameters
  . m                    number of rows, dim(u)
  . n                    number of columns, dim(v)
  . p                    probability of observing an entry
  . mc                   monte carlo number
  . cosL                 cos of angle between u and uhat
  . cosR                 cos of angle between v and vhat
  . nsspecfit            linear fit of bulk of Mhat agains bulk of the noise
    _slope               slope
    _intercept           intercept
    _r2                  fit score (R-squared)
  . entr_noise_std       standard deviaiton of each entry of the noise matrix
  . noise_frob_squared   squared frobenius norm of the noise matrix (is approximately m * n * entr_noise_std^2)
  . sv0, sv1, ...        singular values of Mhat
  . phi                  (1 - phi)m rows have entr_noise_std and phi * m rows have larger noise tau * entr_noise_std
  . tau                  last phi * m rows have std tau * entr_noise_std
  . q_order              takes two values: row, col  indicated along which dim noise sclation is applied
